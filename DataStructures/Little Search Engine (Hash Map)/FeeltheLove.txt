"Feel The Love"

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
I can still feel the love
I can still feel the love
I can still feel the love
Feel the love

[Pusha-T (Kid Cudi):]
We not worried 'bout no other niggas, we them other niggas
You bust down a Rollie, I bust down a brick, then I flood it, nigga
I am not to be compared to you rappers (Eazy-Duz-It) nigga
I am more Eazy, you tryin' your best to become me, nigga
She like them bottles with bubbles in it
Buy her Loewe and other linen
Why would I wait when there's other women?
Why would I hate? We in love with winnin', ooh
Buy her bundles, fly her out, bring her friend, I try her out
Ain't no worries findin' out, the details is ironed out
Easily they plays along, hopin' that I play a song
Love to fuck to trap music (feel the love)
