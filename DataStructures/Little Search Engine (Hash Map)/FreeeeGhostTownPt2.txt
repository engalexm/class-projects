"Freeee (Ghost Town, Pt. 2)"

[Marcus Garvey:]
May I say something to you to give you a true knowledge of yourself and life?
Man in the full knowledge of himself is a superb and supreme creature of creation
When man becomes possessor of the knowledge of himself, he becomes the master of his environment
